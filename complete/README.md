I followed these steps:

1. I opened a terminal shell (Bash).
1. I cloned that fork to my laptop.
1. I navigated to the root of the forked repository clone.
1. I created a new branch:  `git checkout -b Rob`
1. I navigated to this `complete` subdirectory.
1. I invoked the build:  `./gradlew bootRun`
   based on instructions [here](https://spring.io/guides/gs/spring-boot/).
1. That failed with this error:
> The operation couldnâ€™t be completed. Unable to locate a Java Runtime.
